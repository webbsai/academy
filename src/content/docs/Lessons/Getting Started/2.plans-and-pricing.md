WebbsAI offers three primary plan categories: Free, Standard, and Pro.

The Free plan is perfect for simple sites. You get three unhosted sites, 1 GB storage, and up to 50 form submissions. With the Standard plan, you can easily import code from different platforms for a more customized design. By going Pro, you can monitor the user traffic for your site and make your website more secure. With every plan, you can use our generative AI chatbot SinaAI, and simple creative prompts, to accelerate the development rate of your site.

When you decide to publish and scale your domain, you can always connect a custom domain with us or any domain name provider.

Choose a plan that fits your site type. The Free plan works well for static pages, like a Tribute page. If your site needs dynamic content and handles heavy traffic, like a streaming service or any e-commerce platform, consider upgrading to a more advanced plan.
